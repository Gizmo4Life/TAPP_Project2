Project 2 - Stellar Fugitive

This is where all code for teamA is hosted and developed. All source files will be contained in /src. All media (image and sound files) are contained in /media. You can use run.bat to compile and run the program in Windows, and you can use run.sh to run the program in Mac + *nix.

The /lib and /native directories should contain the necessary library files needed to run the program (which is not included in this repository).
