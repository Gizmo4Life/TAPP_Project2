Stellar Fugitive - EF

This is the master branch for the Stellar Fugitive game (Erik's Fork). All source files will be contained in /src. All media (image and sound files) are contained in /media. You can use run.bat to compile and run the program in Windows.

The /lib and /native directories should contain the necessary library and native files needed to run the program (which is not included in this repository).
